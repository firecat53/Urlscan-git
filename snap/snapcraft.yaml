summary: Extract and browse the URLs contained in an email (urlview replacement)
description: |
  urlscan searches for URLs in email messages, then displays a list of
  them in the current terminal.  It is primarily meant as a replacement
  for urlview, which it improves upon in the following ways:
    * urlscan understands email encodings such as quoted-printable;
      urlview does not.
    * urlscan extracts and displays the context surrounding each URL.
